## Sustaining innovation (5/6/19)

What is sustaining innovation / disrupting innovation and what's the difference?

Sustaining: Existing technology developed organically to to improve performance and/or features

Disrupting: New offering that leaves the path of existing technologies and offers either completely new functionality or surpasses performance / features of existing offerings.

Two types: Low-end disruption / New market disruption

New market disruptions can be non-traditional and might have an uncertain future 

**Business Model Framework**

At the core of the Business Model Framework lies the value proposition / USP / offering of the company. On one side is the target customer, who can either be served directly or indirectly (through partners). It's important to to create a good customer relationship and define channels to reach them.
On the other side is the company's infrastructure, or Architecture of Value. This defines how the product/service will be delivered of produced/created. Most important aspects in this area are the core competencies, the partner network and the value configuration.
Last but not least is the financial view, which shows the cost structure and the supporting revenue stream.
