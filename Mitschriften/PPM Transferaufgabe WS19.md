*Pick one of the theories from the marketing course and compare how the theory applies to your employer*

My last employer, Hewlett-Packard GmbH, used the Balanced Scorecard for Marketing, but we did not cover this in our class.

Now, as a self-employed freelance consultant, I use the 4P Marketing Mix to promote my services.

Even though the four Ps have since been expanded to 7 (and sometimes 8), the original four still remain valid:

 - Product
 - Place
 - Price
 - Promotion
 
 How do I apply these?
 
**Product:** As a consultant, I mainly offer consulting services and need to make sure that content and skills that I offer, match current market demands 
**Place:** IT consulting is mainly performed at the customer's premises, so I need to offer the willingness to travel and flexible schedules
**Price:** To set my daily rates, I conduct analysis on the main freelance platforms, to make sure that my rates are competitive, but not below market average and not undercut my value
**Promotion:** I use the business networks (LinkeIn, Xing) for promotion, by publishing posts and articles on my field of work, I also use conferences and meetups to speak, share my knowledge and thus advertise

All in all, the venerable 4P Marketing Mix is a great tool to support my business and foster future growth!
