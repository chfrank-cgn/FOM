> Goodwill is an intangible asset associated with the purchase of one
> company by another. Specifically, goodwill is recorded in a situation
> in which the purchase price is higher than the sum of the fair value
> of all identifiable tangible and intangible assets purchased in the
> acquisition and the liabilities assumed in the process. The value of a
> company’s brand name, solid customer base, good customer relations,
> good employee relations, and any patents or proprietary technology
> represent some examples of goodwill. Goodwill is considered an
> intangible (or noncurrent) asset because it is not a physical asset
> like buildings or equipment. The goodwill account can be found in the
> assets portion of a company's balance sheet.
