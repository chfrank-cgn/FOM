**BCG matrix (or growth-share matrix)**

> BCG matrix is a framework created by Boston Consulting Group to evaluate the strategic position of the business brand portfolio and its potential. It classifies business portfolio into four categories based on industry attractiveness (growth rate of that industry) and competitive position (relative market share). These two dimensions reveal likely profitability of the business portfolio in terms of cash needed to support that unit and cash generated by it. The general purpose of the analysis is to help understand, which brands the firm should invest in and which ones should be divested.

**Financial Planning**

Essentially covers these areas:
- Investments
- Resource requirements
- Liquidity Planning
- Marketing operations
- Development operations

Key elements of financial planning:
- Collect data (sales, costs, ..) from last period
- Goals (top-down plan)
- First step:
	- Volume per SKU/Product/Customer/Region
	- Price per unit 
	- Bottom-up: Planning from the price per unit upward

Three core elements:
- Liquidity planning
- Profit/Loss calculation
- Balance sheet

**Degrees of Liquidity:**

Liquidity 1st degree = (Liquid assets / Short-term borrowed capital) * 100%
- Goal: 10% to 30% of capital

Liquidity 2nd degree = (Liquid assets + short-term receivables / Short-term borrowed capital) * 100%
- Goal: 100% of capital

Liquidity 3rd degree = (Liquid assets + short-term receivables + stock / Short-term borrowed capital) * 100%
- Goal: 200% of capital

The **Golden Financing Rule** ( also know as **Golden Banking Rule**) requires matching maturities: 
- The maturity of the financial assets must match the maturity of their application. The capital should not be limited to a shorter time than is required by the assets.

**Cash flow** is used in two respects:
- Analysis of financial strength (internal financial strength)
- Analysis of earning power of a company

Cash flow = Annual profit (result after tax) + Expenses which have not led to pay-outs + Income which has not led to deposits

Cash flow = Annual profit + Write-offs + Provisions amendment *(simple version)*

Cash flow statement:
- Direct method:
	- The direct method for creating a cash flow statement reports major classes of gross cash receipts and payments.
	- Example: Flowtify
- Indirect method:
	- The indirect method uses net-income as a starting point, makes adjustments for all transactions for non-cash items, then adjusts from all cash-based transactions. An increase in an asset account is subtracted from net income, and an increase in a liability account is added back to net income.
	- Example: DTAG

**Profit/Loss calculation (P&L)**

- Important tool for potential investors to assess the outcomes to expect.
- Time period-related comparisons of expenditure and income.
- The P&L outcome corresponds to the balance (equity capital account).
- P&L and the balance form the so-called annual profit
- There are two processes concerning the P&L:
	- Total cost method
	- Cost-of-sales method

**Balance sheets**

A balance sheet reports a company's assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity at a specific point in time, and provides a basis for computing rates of return and evaluating its capital structure. It is a financial statement that provides a snapshot of what a company owns and owes, as well as the amount invested by shareholders.

Assets include:
- Cash and cash equivalents: the most liquid assets, which may include Treasury bills, short-term certificates of deposit and cash
- Marketable securities: equity and debt securities for which there is a liquid market
- Accounts receivable: money owed to the company by customers
- Inventory: goods available for sale

Liabilities include:
- Debt including long-term debt and Bank indebtedness
- Rent, tax, utilities
- Wages payable
- Dividends payable

Shareholders' equity:
- Shareholders' equity is equal to a firm's total assets minus its total liabilities and is one of the most common financial metrics employed by analysts to determine the financial health of a company. 
- Shareholders' equity represents the net value of a company, or the amount that would be returned to shareholders if all the company's assets were liquidated and all its debts repaid.

The relationship between balance sheets and profit and loss accounts
- The profit and loss (P&L) account summarises a business' trading transactions - income, sales and expenditure - and the resulting profit or loss for a given period.
- The balance sheet, by comparison, provides a financial snapshot at a given moment. It doesn't show day-to-day transactions or the current profitability of the business.

**EBITDA** = Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
**EBIT** = Earnings before interest and tax
**Net Profit** = Earnings after tax *(EaT)*

**Profitability calculation**

By profitability an amount ratio is understood, by which an outcome quantity is placed in relation to that of this result according to the certain influencing factors.

Characteristics:
- Return on equity
- Return on total capital
- Business return
- Return on sales

**Equity capital return:**

Return on equity = (Year-end result / Equity capital + (hidden reserves)) * 100%

> Hidden reserves are part of the equity capital for which the amount however is not immediately evident on the balance sheet and mostly remains unconsidered

**Total capital return:**

Return on total capital = (Year-end result + interest paid / Total capital + (hidden reserves)) * 100%

**Business return:**

Business return = (ordinary Operating profit / average Operating capital) * 100%
Operating capital = Intangible fixed assets + Tangible fixed assets + Stocks (minus deposits) + Customer requirements - Liabilities

**Sales return:**

Sales return 1 (operational margin) = (ordinary Operating profit / Net sales revenue) * 100%

Sales return 2 = (Year-end result / Net sales revenue) * 100%

**ROCE** (Return on Capital Employed )

Return on capital employed is a financial ratio that measures a company's profitability and the efficiency with which its capital is employed; it is calculated as:

ROCE = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) / Capital Employed

CAPEX = Capital Expenditure
OPEX = Operating Expenses
