**BCG matrix (or growth-share matrix)**

> BCG matrix is a framework created by Boston Consulting Group to evaluate the strategic position of the business brand portfolio and its potential. It classifies business portfolio into four categories based on industry attractiveness (growth rate of that industry) and competitive position (relative market share). These two dimensions reveal likely profitability of the business portfolio in terms of cash needed to support that unit and cash generated by it. The general purpose of the analysis is to help understand, which brands the firm should invest in and which ones should be divested.

See [BCG Matrix explained](https://www.strategicmanagementinsight.com/tools/bcg-matrix-growth-share.html)

4 Quadrants:
- Dogs
- Cash Cows
- Question Marks
- Stars

2 Axis:
- Market growth
- Market share

**Financial Planning**

Essentially covers these areas:
- Investments
- Resource requirements
- Liquidity Planning
- Marketing operations
- Development operations

Key elements of financial planning:
- Collect data (sales, costs, ..) from last period
- Goals (top-down plan)
- First step:
	- Volume per SKU/Product/Customer/Region
	- Price per unit 
	- Bottom-up: Planning from the price per unit upward

Three core elements:
- Liquidity planning
- Profit/Loss calculation
- Balance sheet

**Degrees of Liquidity:**

Liquidity 1st degree = (Liquid assets / Short-term borrowed capital) * 100%
- Goal: 10% to 30% of capital

Liquidity 2nd degree = (Liquid assets + short-term receivables / Short-term borrowed capital) * 100%
- Goal: 100% of capital

Liquidity 3rd degree = (Liquid assets + short-term receivables + stock / Short-term borrowed capital) * 100%
- Goal: 200% of capital

The **Golden Financing Rule** ( also know as **Golden Banking Rule**) requires matching maturities: 
- The maturity of the financial assets must match the maturity of their application. The capital should not be limited to a shorter time than is required by the assets.

**Cash flow** is used in two respects:
- Analysis of financial strength (internal financial strength)
- Analysis of earning power of a company

Cash flow = Annual profit (result after tax) + Expenses which have not led to pay-outs + Income which has not led to deposits

Cash flow = Annual profit + Write-offs + Provisions amendment *(simple version)*

Cash flow statement:
- Direct method:
	- The direct method for creating a cash flow statement reports major classes of gross cash receipts and payments.
	- Example: Flowtify
- Indirect method:
	- The indirect method uses net-income as a starting point, makes adjustments for all transactions for non-cash items, then adjusts from all cash-based transactions. An increase in an asset account is subtracted from net income, and an increase in a liability account is added back to net income.
	- Example: DTAG

**Profit/Loss calculation (P&L)**

- Important tool for potential investors to assess the outcomes to expect.
- Time period-related comparisons of expenditure and income.
- The P&L outcome corresponds to the balance (equity capital account).
- P&L and the balance form the so-called annual profit
- There are two processes concerning the P&L:
	- Total cost method
	- Cost-of-sales method

**Balance sheets**

A balance sheet reports a company's assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity at a specific point in time, and provides a basis for computing rates of return and evaluating its capital structure. It is a financial statement that provides a snapshot of what a company owns and owes, as well as the amount invested by shareholders.

Assets include:
- Cash and cash equivalents: the most liquid assets, which may include Treasury bills, short-term certificates of deposit and cash
- Marketable securities: equity and debt securities for which there is a liquid market
- Accounts receivable: money owed to the company by customers
- Inventory: goods available for sale

Liabilities include:
- Debt including long-term debt and Bank indebtedness
- Rent, tax, utilities
- Wages payable
- Dividends payable

Shareholders' equity:
- Shareholders' equity is equal to a firm's total assets minus its total liabilities and is one of the most common financial metrics employed by analysts to determine the financial health of a company. 
- Shareholders' equity represents the net value of a company, or the amount that would be returned to shareholders if all the company's assets were liquidated and all its debts repaid.

The relationship between balance sheets and profit and loss accounts
- The profit and loss (P&L) account summarises a business' trading transactions - income, sales and expenditure - and the resulting profit or loss for a given period.
- The balance sheet, by comparison, provides a financial snapshot at a given moment. It doesn't show day-to-day transactions or the current profitability of the business.

**EBITDA** = Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
**EBIT** = Earnings before interest and tax
**Net Profit** = Earnings after tax *(EaT)*

**Profitability calculation**

By profitability an amount ratio is understood, by which an outcome quantity is placed in relation to that of this result according to the certain influencing factors.

Characteristics:
- Return on equity
- Return on total capital
- Business return
- Return on sales

**Equity capital return:**

Return on equity = (Year-end result / Equity capital + (hidden reserves)) * 100%

> Hidden reserves are part of the equity capital for which the amount however is not immediately evident on the balance sheet and mostly remains unconsidered

**Total capital return:**

Return on total capital = (Year-end result + interest paid / Total capital + (hidden reserves)) * 100%

**Business return:**

Business return = (ordinary Operating profit / average Operating capital) * 100%
Operating capital = Intangible fixed assets + Tangible fixed assets + Stocks (minus deposits) + Customer requirements - Liabilities

**Sales return:**

Sales return 1 (operational margin) = (ordinary Operating profit / Net sales revenue) * 100%

Sales return 2 = (Year-end result / Net sales revenue) * 100%

**ROCE** (Return on Capital Employed )

Return on capital employed is a financial ratio that measures a company's profitability and the efficiency with which its capital is employed; it is calculated as:

ROCE = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) / Capital Employed

CAPEX = Capital Expenditure
OPEX = Operating Expenses

Warren Buffet: 5/25
- Focus on the top 5 goals, ignore the rest
- Stick to it! (Implementation / Finish)
- Changes come with costs ("opportunity costs")

80/20 Rule
- Typically, 20% of SKUs generate 80% of profit

[Pareto diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_chart)
The purpose of the Pareto chart is to highlight the most important among a (typically large) set of factors. In quality control, it often represents the most common sources of defects, the highest occurring type of defect, or the most frequent reasons for customer complaints, and so on.

[Diminishing returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns)
The law of diminishing returns states that in all productive processes, adding more of one factor of production, while holding all others constant ("ceteris paribus"), will at some point yield lower incremental per-unit returns.

**Exam hint:** Ansoff Matrix, BCG Matrix, other decision tools

Depreciation: a reduction in the value of an asset over time, due in particular to wear and tear. "provision should be made for depreciation of fixed assets"

Write-off: A write-off is a (extraordinary) deduction in the value of earnings by the amount of an expense or loss.

Operating profit: EBIT

Net profit: EBITDA

Check ROCE: https://www.onvista.de/

As long as ROCE is greater than WACC, it is worth to leverage financing - *"financial leverage" on your equity*

**ROE** - Return (profit) on equity
**ROI/ROCE** - Return (profit) on overall captial / investment

Functions of Finance:
- Budgeting
- Accounting (Balance sheets / P&L)
- Controlling (Cash-out, budget actual vs planned)
- Money transfers (e.g. Salary)
- Financing (Loans)
- Investing (Calculating profitability)

Financing is a part of Finance

**Investment**: One cash-out leads to regular cash-ins

**Financing**: One cash-in leads to regular cash-outs

Factoring: [Del credere function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_credere)
A del credere position is that of a surety who is liable to the principal should the purchaser make default. The agreement between agent and principal need not be reduced to or evidenced by writing, for the undertaking is not a guarantee within the Statute of Frauds.
A Del Credere Agent not only establishes a privity of contract between the principal and the third party but also guarantees to the principal the due performance of the contract by the third party. The agent is liable, however, only when the third party fails to carry out their contract, e.g., by insolvency. The agent is not liable to the principal if the third party refuses to carry out the contract, for example if the buyer refuses to take delivery.

## Discounted Cash Flow

Private equity is an important part of Financing - approx. 20% WW share
Website: https://www.preqin.com/
Average yield is 15% p.A. - very attractive in times of 0% interest offered by banks
Also, the parts years have shown a good performance record - audited and ranked by Preqin and others.

**IRR** - Internal Rate of Return

[Du Pont analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuPont_analysis)
The Du Pont analysis breaks down Return on Equity (that is, the returns that investors receive from the firm) into three distinct elements. This analysis enables the analyst to understand the source of superior (or inferior) return by comparison with companies in similar industries (or between industries).
ROE = (Profit margin)*(Asset turnover)*(Equity multiplier) = (Net profit/Sales)*(Sales/Average Total Assets)*(Average Total Assets/Average Equity) = (Net Profit/Equity)

If the sum of the discounted cash flows (=adjusted for inflation, interest etc.) is greater than the initial investment, it's a good investment

[Time value of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money)
The time value of money is the greater benefit of receiving money now rather than an identical sum later. It is founded on time preference.
The time value of money explains why interest is paid or earned: Interest, whether it is on a bank deposit or debt, compensates the depositor or lender for the time value of money.
It also underlies investment. Investors are willing to forgo spending their money now only if they expect a favorable return on their investment in the future, such that the increased value to be available later is sufficiently high to offset the preference to have money now.

[Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp)
Discounted cash flow (DCF) is a valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its future cash flows. DCF analysis finds the present value of expected future cash flows using a discount rate. A present value estimate is then used to evaluate a potential investment. If the value calculated through DCF is higher than the current cost of the investment, the opportunity should be considered.

DCF= CF1 / (1+r)^1^ + CF2 / (1+r)^2^ + CF3 / (1+r)^3^ + ...
(CF = Cash Flow, r = discount rate)

[Compounding](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compounding.asp)
Compounding is the process in which an asset's earnings, from either capital gains or interest, are reinvested to generate additional earnings over time. This growth, calculated using exponential functions, occurs because the investment will generate earnings from both its initial principal and the accumulated earnings from preceding periods. Compounding, therefore, differs from linear growth, where only the principal earns interest each period.

[Discounting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discounting.asp)
Discounting is the process of determining the present value of a payment or a stream of payments that is to be received in the future. Given the time value of money, a dollar is worth more today than it would be worth tomorrow. Discounting is the primary factor used in pricing a stream of tomorrow's cash flows.

> In essence, every company is a series of cashflows

**Question:** How to get to the discount rate? Check the [WACC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp)!

**WACC**
- Cost of debt (=Fremdkapitalzinsen)
- Cost of equity (=Eigenkapitalkosten)

Example: Financing 500kEur - 400kEur debt at 5% and 100kEur equity at 10% -> WACC

See worksheet `/fom/mb/present-value-heritage`

**DCF** (See whiteboard photo `/fom/mb/img_20190108_141235`)

[Maslow pyramid of needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html)

> Goods are means to satisfy a need

Economic principle:
- Maximum: Fixed input, maximized output
- Minimum: Fixed output, minimized input

Trade-off:
*"There's no such thing as a free lunch"*
-> Opportunity costs, e.g. money, time, other needs

[Comparative Advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage)
Comparative advantage is the economic reality describing the work gains from trade for individuals, firms, or nations, which arise from differences in their factor endowments or technological progress. In an economic model, agents have a comparative advantage over others in producing a particular good if they can produce that good at a lower relative opportunity cost or autarky price, i.e. at a lower relative marginal cost prior to trade.
The law or principle of comparative advantage holds that under free trade, an agent will produce more of and consume less of a good for which they have a comparative advantage. **Free trade beats protectionism!**

Price elasticity (pg 46-48):
- High elasticity: High quantity reduction at a certain price increase
- Low elasticity: Low quantity reduction at a certain price increase
