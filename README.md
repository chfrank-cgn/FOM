# FOM

My personal artefacts from my studies in Witschaftsinformatik - Busines Information Systems

- In "Mitschriften" you'll find my notes taken in class for various subjects in Markdown format
- in "PP" you'll find sample C code for the Prozedurales Programmieren class, lovingly handcrafted in vi and gcc
- in "OPP" you'll find sample Java code for the Objetkorientiertes Programmieren class, lovingly handcrafted in vi and javac


Enjoy!
