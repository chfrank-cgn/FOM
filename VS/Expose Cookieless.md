# Introduction to Microtargeting

"Microtargeting is a marketing strategy that uses people's data - about what they like, who they're connected to, what their demographics are, what they've purchased, and more - to segment them into small groups for content targeting. It's the reason that if you typically shop at Whole Foods, you may be served an advertisement for organic sunscreen during the Summer. And while it can help deliver content that is interesting and helpful to you, it also has a dark side - especially if it delivers information that's inaccurate or biased and meant to sway your vote."

# Is there an issue?

Vendors making useful recommendations is a good thing, isn't it? However:

- With tracking cookies and browser fingerprinting, unique users can easily be identified
- Companies can track their users and can create very detailed user profiles
- Companies collect a lot of personal data
- Personal data can be sold or otherwise misused

Also, the legal framework is changing:

- Data processing is being limited through GDPR and CCPA, strengthening user privacy
- The EU's upcoming Digital Services Act might prohibit tracking cookies
- There's also the EU's e-Privacy Directive, even though no consensus has been reached

# Research Question

Can we not merely stop targeting ads on the web? And go back to the macro targeting of old, similar to billboards, newspapers, or linear broadcasting?

Research, though, has shown repeatedly that targeted advertising works and can help companies increase sales significantly.

Maybe there is a way to keep the benefits of targeted advertising while minimizing its downside.

In this paper, we want to look at possible strategies for cookieless online marketing and advertising to find a way to place meaningful ads while maintaining and safeguarding user privacy.

For our research, we will limit our focus to commercial advertising exclusively and exclude political advertising.

# Methods

To identify possible strategies, we'll combine two methods in our research design:

- Literature / Tools review
- Qualitative research

to explore and analyze the existing situation and the upcoming changes in the legal frameworks in regards to tracking.

Based on our findings, we'll then propose a possible strategy going forward.

---

# Research design (1/3)

First, we will explore select tools that make use of tracking cookies:

- Google Analytics Standard, Google Analytics 4 Properties
- Google Ads, AdWords
- Amazon Advertising
- Facebook Advertising

We'll then explore an open-source, GDPR-compliant tool for web analytics:

- Plausible Analytics

an approach to avoing tracking cookies when placing ads:

- Context-based ads placement at Nederlandse Publieke Omroep

and conduct one or more problem-centered interviews with an advertising or SEO agency.

---

# Research design (2/3)

Second, we will review available literature on existing and upcoming legislation in regards to tracking:

- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- DSA (Digital Services Act)
- e-Privacy Proposal

and conduct one or more problem-centered interviews with a specialised lawyer.

---

# Research design (3/3)

Based on the tools exploration, literature review and qualitative content analysis of our interviews, we'll then try to identify an option for placing targeted ads that is:

- Respecting user privacy
- Legal
- Efficient and increasing ad revenues

If we do not want to track the individual user, a possible solution could be to focus primarily on the current browsing context, and place ads accordingly.
